# Installing R

Install R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN):

https://cran.r-project.org/


&lt;img src="img/cran.png" width="3589" /&gt;

--

You are recommended to use the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) (*but you do not have to*).


---
class: left, top

# Download RStudio

https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

&lt;img src="img/rstudio.png" width="2995" /&gt;

# Running R Commands

You can run R commands in the Console by entering them after the `&gt;` operator (see example in R below)

.pull-left[


```r
print("Hello World")
```

```
## [1] "Hello World"
```

# R Syntax

--

### The R syntax is comprised of two major elements:

--

.pull-left[

## Functions

#### *Functions perform operations: calculate a mean, build a table, create a graph, etc.*

]


--

.pull-right[

## Objects

#### *Objects hold information: a collection of numbers, dates, words, models results, etc.* 

]

---
class: center, middle

# We use functions to perform operations on objects

---
class: left, top

# Example: create a vector of numbers

The standard assignment operator in R is `&lt;-`. We can use this in combination with `c()` to create an object `x`, which contains five numbers (`1`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `9`).  


```r
*x &lt;- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
```

--

Place `x` inside `print()` to print `x` to the console  


```r
x &lt;- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
*print(x)
```

&lt;!-- NOTE: We can also use the `=` and move `-&gt;` to the end of the expression, but this is not recommended --&gt;


---
class: left 

# R Syntax: functions


```r
x &lt;- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
print(x)
```

```
## [1] 1 3 5 7 9
```

In the example above, we've created object `x`, but what are `&lt;-` and `c()`?

--

We can check this by passing them both in backticks to the `class()` function below.

--


```r
class(`&lt;-`)
```

```
## [1] "function"
```

--


```r
class(`c`)
```

```
## [1] "function"
```

--

As we can see, these are **functions**.  

---
class: left

# Functions in R

***

.pull-left[

Objects are like nouns: they hold information


```r
object_1 &lt;- "Sally"
object_2 &lt;- "dog"
object_3 &lt;- "road"
```

]

--

.pull-right[

Functions are like verbs: they do things to nouns


```r
work()
run()
implement()
```

]

--

***

#### ***Functions*** perform operations (calculate, transform, model, graph) on various ***objects*** that contain information (blood pressure measurements, monthly sales, political party affiliation, etc.)

---
class: left

# Functions and objects

Functions perform operations on objects.

--

*Sally works.*


```r
object_1 &lt;- "Sally"
*work(object_1)
```

--

*The dog runs.*


```r
object_2 &lt;- "dog"
*run(object_2)
```

--

*Implement the idea.*


```r
object_3 &lt;- "idea"
*implement(object_3)
```


---
class: left, top

# Packages and functions in R 

Functions are stored in R packages. Fortunately, R comes 'out-of-the-box' with a set of functions for basic data management and statistical calculations.

To access the functions in a package, use the following syntax:


```r
package::function(object)
```

--

The `median()` function comes from the `stats` package.


```r
stats::median(x)
```

```
## [1] 5
```

--

The `typeof()` function comes from the `base` package.


```r
base::typeof(x)
```

```
## [1] "double"
```

---
class: left

# Packages and functions

Use tab-completion and the arrow keys in RStudio to explore a packages functions. 

&lt;img src="img/tab-completion.png" width="2123" /&gt;

--

We can take advantage of tab-completion by using names that allow us to look up common objects. For example, naming plot objects with a `plot_` prefix will allow us to use tab-completion to scroll through each object without having to remember the specific name.

---
class: left

# Installing packages from CRAN

To install packages from CRAN, we can use the `install.packages()` function.


```r
install.packages("package name")
```

NOTE: *if this is the first time installing packages, you'll probably be presented with a list of CRAN “mirrors” to use--choose the mirror closest to you.*

---
class: left, top

# Installing packages from CRAN in RStudio

You can also use the **Packages** pane in RStudio

&lt;img src="img/install-package.png" width="50%" height="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
class: left

# Installing user packages

The code for user-written packages are typically stored in code repository, like [Github.](https://github.com/) 

To access all of the great user-created packages for R that haven't been uploaded to CRAN, you'll need to install the `devtools` or `remotes` packages. 


```r
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("remotes")
```

--

To install these packages, we can use `devtools::install_github()` or `remotes::install_github()`, and then the author's username and name of the package repository.


```r
devtools::install_github(&lt;username&gt;/&lt;package&gt;)
remotes::install_github(&lt;username&gt;/&lt;package&gt;)
```

# Objects

--

### *R is typically referred to as an "object-oriented programming" language.*

--

### *We've covered functions, so now we'll dive into the aspects of some common R objects.*

---
class: left, top

# Types of objects in R 

- vectors

 - atomic (logical, integer, double, and character)
 
 - S3 (factors, dates, date-times, durations)

- matrices

- arrays

- data frames

- tibbles

- lists

---
class: left, top

# Atomic vectors

Vectors are the fundamental data type in R. 

--

Many of R's functions are *vectorised*, which means they're designed for performing operations on vectors.

--

The "atomic" in atomic vectors means, "*of or forming a single irreducible unit or component in a larger system.*"

--

Atomic vectors can be logical, integer, double, or character (strings). 

--

We will build each of these vectors using the previously covered assignment operator (`&lt;-`) and `c()` function (*which stands for 'combine'*).

---
class: left, top

# Store and explore

--

.pull-left[

A common practice in R is to create an object, perform an operation on that object with a function, and store the results in new object.

We then explore the contents of the new object with another function. 

]

--

.pull-right[

&lt;img src="img/store-explore.png" width="120%" height="120%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

]

--

***

Many of the functions in R are written with this *store and explore* process in mind.

---
class: left, top

# Atomic vectors: numeric

The two atomic numeric vectors are integer and double. 

--

Integer vectors are created with a number and capital letter `L` (i.e. `1L`, `10L`)


```r
vec_integer &lt;- c(1L, 10L, 100L)
```

--

Double vectors can be entered as decimals, but they can also be created in scientific notation (`2.46e8`), or values determined by the floating point standard (`Inf`, `-Inf` and `NaN`).


```r
vec_double &lt;- c(0.1, 1.0, 10.01)
```

---
class: left, top

# Atomic vectors: numeric

We will use the `typeof()` and `is.numeric()` functions to explore the contents of `vec_integer` and `vec_double`.


```r
typeof(vec_integer)
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

--


```r
is.numeric(vec_integer)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

--

`typeof()` tells us that this is an `"integer"` vector, and `is.numeric()` tests to see if it is numeric (which is `TRUE`).


---
class: left, top

# Atomic vectors: logical vectors

Logical vectors can be `TRUE` or `FALSE` (or `T` or `F` for short). Below we use `typeof()` and `is.logical()` to explore the contents of `vec_logical`.

--


```r
vec_logical &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE)
typeof(vec_logical)
```

```
## [1] "logical"
```

--


```r
is.logical(vec_logical)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

---
class: left, top

# Atomic vectors: logical vectors


Logical vectors are handy because we when we add them together, and the total number tells us how many `TRUE` values there are. 


```r
TRUE + TRUE + FALSE + TRUE
```

```
## [1] 3
```

--

Logical vectors can be useful for subsetting (a way of extracting certain elements from a particular object) based on a set of conditions. 

--

*How many elements in `vec_integer` are greater than `5`?*


```r
vec_integer &gt; 5
```

```
## [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
```



---
class: left, top

# Atomic vectors: character vectors

Character vectors store text data (note the double quotes). We'll *store and explore* again.

--


```r
vec_character &lt;- c("A", "B", "C")
typeof(vec_character)
```

```
## [1] "character"
```

--


```r
is.character(vec_character)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

--

Character vectors typically store text information that we need to include in a calculation, visualization, or model. In these cases, we'll need to convert them into `factor`s. We'll cover those next. 

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# S3 vectors

### *S3 vectors can be factors, dates, date-times, and difftimes.*

---
class: left, top

# S3 vectors: factors

Factors are categorical vectors with a given set of responses. Below we create a factor with three levels: `low`, `medium`, and `high`

--


```r
vec_factor &lt;- factor(x = c("low", "medium", "high"))
class(vec_factor)
```

```
## [1] "factor"
```

--

Factors are not character variables, though. They get stored with an integer indicator for each character level. 


```r
typeof(vec_factor)
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

---
class: left, top

# S3 vectors: factor attributes

Factors are integer vectors with two additional attributes: `class` is set to `factor`, and `levels` for each unique response.

--

We can check this with `unique()` and `attributes()` functions. 


```r
unique(vec_factor)
```

```
## [1] low    medium high  
*## Levels: high low medium
```

--


```r
attributes(vec_factor)
```

```
*## $levels
## [1] "high"   "low"    "medium"
## 
## $class
## [1] "factor"
```

---
class: left, top

# S3 vectors: factor attributes 

Levels are assigned alphabetically, but we can manually assign the order of factor levels with the `levels` argument in `factor()`.

--


```r
vec_factor &lt;- factor(x = c("medium", "high", "low"), 
                     levels = c("low", "medium", "high"))
```

--

We can check the levels with `levels()` or `unclass()`


```r
levels(vec_factor)
```

```
## [1] "low"    "medium" "high"
```

--


```r
unclass(vec_factor)
```

```
*## [1] 2 3 1
## attr(,"levels")
*## [1] "low"    "medium" "high"
```


---
class: left, top

# S3 vectors: date

Dates are stored as `double` vectors with a `class` attribute set to `Date`.  

--

R has a function for getting today's date, `Sys.Date()`. We'll create a `vec_date` using `Sys.Date()` and adding `1` and `2` to this value. 


```r
vec_date &lt;- c(Sys.Date(), Sys.Date() + 1, Sys.Date() + 2)
vec_date
```

```
## [1] "2020-10-11" "2020-10-12"
## [3] "2020-10-13"
```

--

We can see adding units to the `Sys.Date()` added days to today's date. 

--

The `attributes()` function tells us this vector has it's own class. 


```r
attributes(vec_date)
```

```
## $class
## [1] "Date"
```

---
class: left, top

# S3 vectors: date calculations

Dates are stored as a number because they represent the amount of days since January 1, 1970, which is referred to as the [UNIX Epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

--

`unclass()` tells us what the actual number is.


```r
unclass(vec_date)
```

```
## [1] 18546 18547 18548
```


---
class: left, top

# S3 vectors: date-time

Date-times contain a bit more information than dates. The function to create a datetime vector is `as.POSIXct()`. 

We'll convert `vec_date` to a date-time and store it in `vec_datetime_ct`. View the results below.

--


```r
vec_date
```

```
## [1] "2020-10-11" "2020-10-12"
## [3] "2020-10-13"
```

--


```r
vec_datetime_ct &lt;- as.POSIXct(x = vec_date)
vec_datetime_ct
```

```
## [1] "2020-10-10 17:00:00 MST"
## [2] "2020-10-11 17:00:00 MST"
## [3] "2020-10-12 17:00:00 MST"
```

We can see `vec_datetime_ct` stores some additional information. 

---
class: left, top

# S3 vectors: date-time attributes

`vec_datetime_ct` is a `double` vector with an additional attribute of `class` set to `"POSIXct" "POSIXt"`.


```r
typeof(vec_datetime_ct)
```

```
## [1] "double"
```

--


```r
attributes(vec_datetime_ct)
```

```
## $class
## [1] "POSIXct" "POSIXt"
```

---
class: left, top

# S3 vectors: date-time help

.pull-left[

Read more about date-times by entering the `as.POSIXct` function into the console preceded by a question mark. 


```r
?as.POSIXct
```

]

--

.pull-right[

&lt;img src="img/help-date-time.png" width="120%" height="120%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

]

---
class: left, top

# S3 vectors: difftime

Difftimes are durations, so we need to supply two dates, which we will create with `time_01` and `time_02`.


```r
time_01 &lt;- Sys.Date()
time_02 &lt;- Sys.Date() + 10
vec_difftime &lt;- difftime(time_01, time_02, units = "days")
vec_difftime
```

```
## Time difference of -10 days
```

--

Difftimes are stored as a `double` vector. 


```r
typeof(vec_difftime)
```

```
## [1] "double"
```

---
class: left, top

# S3 vectors: difftime attributes

Difftimes are their own `class` and have a `units` attribute set to whatever we've specified in the `units` argument.



```r
attributes(vec_difftime)
```

```
## $class
## [1] "difftime"
## 
*## $units
## [1] "days"
```

--

We can see the actual number stored in the vector with `unclass()`


```r
unclass(vec_difftime)
```

```
## [1] -10
*## attr(,"units")
## [1] "days"
```


---
class: left, top

# Matrices 

A matrix is several vectors stored together into two a two-dimensional object. 


```r
mat_data &lt;- matrix(data = c(vec_double, vec_integer), 
                   nrow = 3, ncol = 2, byrow = FALSE)
mat_data
```

```
##       [,1] [,2]
## [1,]  0.10    1
## [2,]  1.00   10
## [3,] 10.01  100
```

This is a three-column, two-row matrix. 

We can check the dimensions of `mat_data` with `dim()`.


```r
dim(mat_data)
```

```
## [1] 3 2
```


---
class: left, top

# Matrix positions

The output in the console tells us where each element is located in `mat_data`. 

For example, if I want to get the `10` that's stored in `vec_integer`, I can use look at the output and use the indexes. 

--

.pull-left[


```r
mat_data
```

```
*##       [,1] [,2]
## [1,]  0.10    1
*## [2,]  1.00   10
## [3,] 10.01  100
```

]

--

.pull-right[



```r
mat_data[2, 2]
```

```
## [1] 10
```
]

--

By placing the index (`[2, 2]`) next to the object, I am telling R, "*only return the value in this position*".


---
class: left, top

# Arrays

Arrays are like matrices, but they can have more dimensions. 


```r
dat_array &lt;- array(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
                            14, 15, 16, 17, 18), dim = c(3, 3, 2))
```

--



```r
dat_array
```

```
## , , 1
## 
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    4    7
## [2,]    2    5    8
## [3,]    3    6    9
## 
## , , 2
## 
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]   10   13   16
## [2,]   11   14   17
## [3,]   12   15   18
```


---
class: left, top

# Array layers

`dat_array` contains numbers 1 through 18 in three columns and three rows, stacked in two *layers*. 

Matrices are arrays, but arrays are not matrices. 

--

.pull-left[ 

&lt;img src="img/array.png" width="75%" height="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# Data Frames

Data frames are rectangular data with rows and columns (or observations and variables).


```r
DataFrame &lt;- data.frame(character = c("A", "B", "C"), 
                       integer = c(0.1, 1.0, 10.01), 
                       logical = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), 
                        stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
DataFrame
```

```
*##   character integer logical
## 1         A    0.10    TRUE
## 2         B    1.00   FALSE
## 3         C   10.01    TRUE
```

NOTE: `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` is not required as of R version 4.0.0.

---
class: left

# Data Frames

Check the structure of the `data.frame` with `str()`


```r
str(DataFrame)
```

```
*## 'data.frame':	3 obs. of  3 variables:
##  $ character: chr  "A" "B" "C"
##  $ integer  : num  0.1 1 10
##  $ logical  : logi  TRUE FALSE TRUE
```

`str()` gives us a transposed view of the `DataFrame` object, and tells us the dimensions of the object.

---
class: left

# Tibbles 

Tibbles are a special kind of `data.frame` (they print better to the console and character vectors are never coerced into factors). 

The syntax to build them is slightly different, too.


```r
Tibble &lt;- tibble::tribble(
*      ~character, ~integer,  ~logical,
              "A",      0.1,      TRUE,
              "B",        1,     FALSE,
              "C",    10.01,      TRUE)
Tibble
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 3
##   character integer logical
##   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;  
## 1 A             0.1 TRUE   
## 2 B             1   FALSE  
## 3 C            10.0 TRUE
```


---
class: left

# Tibbles 

Check the structure of `Tibble`.


```r
str(Tibble)
```

```
*## tibble [3 × 3] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
##  $ character: chr [1:3] "A" "B" "C"
##  $ integer  : num [1:3] 0.1 1 10
##  $ logical  : logi [1:3] TRUE FALSE TRUE
```

--

`str()` tells us `tibbles` are `S3` objects, with types  `tbl_df`, `tbl`, and `data.frame`.

---
class: left, top

# Data frames and tibbles 

If you're importing spreadsheets, most of the work you'll do in R will be with rectangular data objects (i.e. `data.frame`s and `tibble`s).

## 2 B             1   FALSE  
## 3 C            10.0 TRUE
```

]

--

If we check the `type` of the `DataFrame` and `Tibble`...

--


```r
typeof(DataFrame)
```

```
## [1] "list"
```

```r
typeof(Tibble)
```

```
## [1] "list"
```

...we see they are `lists`



---
class: left

# Data Frames &amp; Tibbles 

Both `data.frame`s and `tibble`s are their own class, 


```r

## [1] "data.frame"
```

```r
class(Tibble)
```

```
## [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"       
## [3] "data.frame"
```

So we can think of `data.frame`s and `tibble`s as special kinds of *rectangular* lists, made with different types of vectors, with each vector being of equal length.

# Lists 

Lists are special objects because they can contain all other objects (including other lists).


```r
dat_list &lt;- list("integer" = vec_integer, 
                 "array" = dat_array,
                 "matrix data" = mat_data,
                 "data frame" = DataFrame, 
                 "tibble" = Tibble)
```

Lists have a `names` attribute, which we've defined above in double quotes.


```r
attributes(dat_list)
```

```
*## $names
## [1] "integer"     "array"      
## [3] "matrix data" "data frame" 
## [5] "tibble"
```

# List structure

If we check the structure of the `dat_list`, we see the structure of list, and the structure of the elements in the list.


```r
str(dat_list)
```

```
## List of 5
*##  $ integer    : int [1:3] 1 10 100
*##  $ array      : num [1:3, 1:3, 1:2] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
*##  $ matrix data: num [1:3, 1:2] 0.1 1 10 1 10 ...
*##  $ data frame :'data.frame':	3 obs. of  3 variables:
##   ..$ character: chr [1:3] "A" "B" "C"
##   ..$ integer  : num [1:3] 0.1 1 10
##   ..$ logical  : logi [1:3] TRUE FALSE TRUE
*##  $ tibble     : tibble [3 × 3] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
##   ..$ character: chr [1:3] "A" "B" "C"
##   ..$ integer  : num [1:3] 0.1 1 10
##   ..$ logical  : logi [1:3] TRUE FALSE TRUE
```
